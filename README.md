<h1>WEB ENGINEERING: Project 1</h1>
<p>In this project two applications were developed in Ruby, a client-server model application and a Bosch IOT sensor device simulator that sends its readings to the first application, allowing its clients to visualize the conditions of the environment that surrounds any of the sensors in real time.</p>
